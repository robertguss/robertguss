# ðŸ‘‹ Hey I'm Robert

I'm a Senior Software Engineer. You can read my [origin story](https://www.howtocode.io/posts/the-self-taught-developer/how-i-taught-myself-how-to-code) and how I became a self-taught web developer in 5 months [here](https://www.howtocode.io/posts/the-self-taught-developer/how-i-taught-myself-how-to-code).

I create free web development tutorials, courses, and books at [HowtoCode.io](https://www.howtocode.io/).
